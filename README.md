TypeScript Backend API Structure for Team/Project Management
1. Configuration & Tooling
package.json / package-lock.json: Manages project dependencies and scripts. The package-lock.json ensures consistency across environments by locking versions.

tsconfig.json / tsconfig-paths.js: TypeScript configurations for compiling code and managing module resolution with aliases (e.g., @controllers for src/controllers).

.eslintrc.json / .eslintignore: Linting configuration to maintain code quality and style consistency. The .eslintignore specifies files to be excluded from linting.

.prettierrc: Prettier configuration to format code consistently (e.g., indentation, spacing).

.gitignore: Specifies files/folders to be ignored by Git, like node_modules or build artifacts.

2. Database Layer
src/database: Handles database connections and seeding.

createConnection.ts: Configures the PostgreSQL connection using TypeORM.

createGuestAccount.ts & createTestAccount.ts: Seeder scripts to populate the database with demo/test data (users, projects, issues).

resetDatabase.ts: Resets the database schema, useful for testing environments.

3. Entities (ORM Models)
src/entities: Defines TypeORM models, mapping them to database tables.

User, Project, Issue, Comment: Models representing users, projects, issues, and comments. These define table structures and relationships (e.g., User can have many Projects).

4. Constants & Types
src/constants: Holds enums for project categories, issue types, and statuses.

src/types: TypeScript types for Express request/response bodies and environment variables.

5. Controllers (Business Logic)
src/controllers: Contains route handlers for core business logic.

Authentication Controller: Handles login, registration, and JWT token generation.

Project Controller: Manages CRUD operations for projects.

Issue/Comment Controllers: Manage operations related to issues and comments.

Controllers use middleware for validation and error handling.

6. Middleware
src/middleware: Middleware that processes requests before they reach route handlers.

Authentication: Verifies JWT tokens for secured routes.

Error Handling: Catches errors and standardizes error responses.

Response Formatting: Ensures consistent response structure.

7. Utilities
src/utils: Helper functions for common operations.

Validation: Validates incoming data (e.g., checking email formats).

JWT Authentication: Functions for generating, verifying, and decoding JWT tokens.

TypeORM Helpers: Functions to interact with TypeORM models (e.g., creating/updating records).

8. Serializers
src/serializers: Transforms API responses before sending them to the client.

For example, Issue Serialization could format issue data, removing sensitive fields like passwordHash from the response.

9. Routing
routes.ts: Defines API routes and links them to corresponding controllers.

Routes are defined by HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST for user registration, project CRUD operations).

10. Application Entry Point
index.ts: The entry point of the app. It:

Initializes the Express server.

Applies middleware.

Registers routes.

Starts the application to listen for incoming requests.

Summary:
This backend API structure is modular and scalable, allowing for easy expansion:

Database setup: Handles connection and seeding.

Entities: ORM models for mapping data to the database.

Controllers: Contains the core business logic for handling API requests.

Middleware: For authentication, error handling, and response formatting.

Utilities: Helper functions for validation and interacting with the database.

Routing: Defines accessible routes and their corresponding controller actions.

Serialization: Used for transforming API responses before sending them to the client.

This approach ensures maintainability, modularity, and extensibility for the application.

This should make it easier for a developer to understand the structure, as it assumes familiarity with the tools and concepts used in the project.
